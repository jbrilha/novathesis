Current \gls{iot} and domotics systems are fundamentally dependent on
continuous infrastructure availability, which creates critical vulnerabilities
when cloud connectivity fails, access points become unreachable, or centralized
coordinators become unresponsive.

Resolving this dependence is particularly challenging when targeting
resource-constrained platforms due to the conflicting nature of autonomous
operation and the available computational, memory, and energy budgets. The
heterogeneity of available communication protocols (i.e., Wi-Fi, \gls{BLE},
\gls{LoRa}, \gls{ZigBee}, \gls{ESP-NOW}) introduces additional complexity but
-- if properly utilized -- can help mitigate infrastructure dependence by
providing resilience and autonomy through variety.

In this paper we propose \gls{ubabel}\todo{o template não deixa meter o ubabel
assim na cover page.... reverter tudo para "microBabel?"}, a lightweight,
\emph{multi-protocol} communication framework intended to address the
difficulties of decentralized coordination in commodity embedded devices (ESP32
family, Raspberry Pi Pico). Leveraging the available avenues for communication,
we plan to enable resilient, decentralized,  and infrastructure-independent
operation with: adaptive protocol selection based on operating conditions,
\gls{QoS} requirements, and device capabilities; autonomous peer discovery;
gossip-based time synchronization; and lightweight data reduction techniques.

The proposed system is designed for fully autonomous operation, but will allow
for seamless integration with the broader
Babel~\cite{fouto2022babel}\todo{talvez não mencionar o Babel aqui? kinda
shifts focus maybe} ecosystem, further enabling the deployment and formation
of heterogeneous systems where resource-constrained edge devices interoperate
with \emph{optional} computational nodes for enhanced capabilities when
available.
