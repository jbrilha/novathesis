\label{sec:rw_summary}

Table~\ref{tab:rw_summary} summarizes the key architectural differences
between existing work and \textbf{\gls{ubabel}} across the technical domains
examined in this chapter.

A common pattern is present across these domains: existing approaches rely on
centralized coordination mechanisms that become single points of failure during
infrastructure collapse.

Protocol coordination depends on master nodes or \gls{SDN} controllers, mesh
topologies assume consistent connectivity or gateway coordinators, time
synchronization requires master beacons, and authentication protocols depend on
centralized servers or group leaders.

Even distributed approaches like HyParView and \gls{RGCS} make assumptions
(persistent \gls{TCP} connections, single-protocol homogeneity) incompatible
with resource-constrained multi-protocol disaster scenarios.
