\section{Multi-Radio Communication and Adaptive Protocol Selection}
\label{sec:multi_protocol}

\todo{added narrative thingamagig}
Even if devices can self-organize without fixed coordinators, the remaining
issue becomes their ability to communicate across heterogeneous protocol
stacks.

Single-radio (i.e. Wi-Fi only, \gls{BLE} only, \gls{LoRa} only, etc.)
communication architectures are susceptible to a fundamental vulnerability: if
their chosen medium becomes unavailable or inefficient due to interference,
range limitations, or infrastructure failures, the entire system loses
connectivity and most times ceases to operate altogether.

This becomes especially grave in disaster scenarios where communication
conditions change unpredictably due to factors such as \gls{RF} interference
caused by debris, obstacles blocking line-of-sight propagation, or
damaged/unavailable access points.

Existing approaches to multi-radio \gls{iot} systems -- or multi-protocol, as
commonly used in the literature -- can be divided into three categories:
multi-channel resilience architectures that orchestrate communication
technologies for emergency scenarios; implementations that show the feasibility
of radio heterogeneity on embedded platforms; and adaptive selection
frameworks that switch protocols based on runtime conditions.

\subsection{Multi-Channel Resilience Architectures}
\label{subsec:multi-channel}

The \gls{AWCT} framework~\cite{awct} orchestrates \gls{LPWAN} on top of
\gls{LoRaWAN} with ad-hoc networks (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) specifically for
standby emergency communication. Their architecture adds three modules to
standard \gls{iot} devices (Raspberry Pi boards, in their test case): a battery
module for power management, a power interrupt handler that triggers emergency
mode when the power grid fails, and an ad-hoc bridge that forwards packets
between the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and \gls{LPWAN} interfaces.

The system leverages dense \gls{iot} device deployment to provide emergency
coverage, demonstrating that existing infrastructure can still serve a purpose
during scenarios where the main power grid suffers issues. However, AWCT's
reliance on centralized \gls{LoRaWAN} gateways for Internet connectivity
creates a single point of failure when those gateways become unreachable.\\

A more comprehensive heterogeneous approach is presented
in~\cite{heterogeneous-disaster}, which integrates \gls{HF} radio with
\gls{NVIS} technology, satellite links, \glspl{WSN}, and \gls{DTN} with mobile
drones for disaster monitoring. Their system uses \gls{RPL}~\cite{rfc6550} with
three separate instances to differentiate traffic by priority: human data
(voice/text via Bluetooth) receives the highest priority, followed by
drone-collected data and finally sensor data.

The \gls{NVIS} backhaul provides 250 km coverage radius without line-of-sight
requirements, offering a cost-effective alternative to satellite
communications.

While demonstrating successful real-world validation in Antarctica and urban
deployments, the architecture's core \gls{NVIS} topology with centralized coordination
contrasts fully distributed operational requirements. Furthermore, their \gls{WSN}
layer requires a minimum 20-second sending interval to maintain acceptable
packet loss rates at 10 hops, which highlights throughput limitations of
single-channel tree topologies.\\

Security-focused multi-channel approaches like MCSC-WoT~\cite{mcsc-wot} combine
\gls{AES} encryption with dynamic channel hopping across 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels
to defend against jamming and eavesdropping attacks. Their lightweight
synchronization mechanism minimizes energy consumption while maintaining
security through \gls{FHSS} patterns generated via \gls{PRNG}. Nodes that lose
synchronization can rejoin by hopping to random channels and waiting for the
next synchronization signal.

However, the system depends on a master node broadcasting synchronization
signals and uses an initial \gls{PRNG} seed shared among all nodes, raising
questions about scalability and seed distribution mechanisms -- particularly
how new nodes can acquire seeds if deployed to a network some time after the
system is operational.

\subsection{Protocol Heterogeneity on Embedded Platforms}
\label{subsec:proto-het}

The work presented in~\cite{multiproto_gateway} shows the technical feasibility
of multi-radio operation on commodity Wi-Fi/\gls{BLE} modules by integrating
\gls{ESP-NOW}, \gls{ZigBee}, and \gls{Modbus} protocols on devices from the
ESP32 family to construct multi-hop, tree-based wireless networks.

\todo{FIXED: changed this to be more focused on the technical aspect}
\gls{ESP-NOW} requires pairing between peers based on their MAC addresses, thus
some form of discovery is required after deployment. Their implementation uses
\gls{BLE} advertising beacons for neighbor discovery with \gls{RSSI}
measurements (for distance estimation), computing parent selection priorities
based on weighted combinations of child count, \gls{RSSI} values, and hop count
in the network tree of a given node.

Testing demonstrated successful coexistence with \gls{ZigBee} sensors, and
supports the idea that different technologies can cooperate to overcome
individual limitations.\\

\subsection{Runtime Adaptive Protocol Selection}
\label{subsec:runtime-adaptive}

The MINOS platform~\cite{minos2019} exemplifies the limitations of centralized
multi-protocol approaches. While providing sophisticated multi-protocol support
(CORAL-SDN and Adaptable-RPL) with dynamic protocol deployment and real-time
parameter tuning, the system depends fundamentally on a centralized \gls{SDN}
controller, \gls{MQTT} broker, and web server infrastructure. The architecture's
single point of failure means that when the controller becomes unreachable the
entire system loses its adaptive capabilities and reverts to static operation
at best, or complete failure at worst.
\todo{FIXED: removed MDPI paper}

This centralization pattern persists in other multi-protocol/multi-radio
platforms despite their sophistication. MARS~\cite{mars2025} provides
\gls{ML}-based radio selection between \gls{ZigBee} and \gls{BLE} on Raspberry
Pi devices, achieving an increase of up to 49\% in throughput thanks to
optimized switching, but requires fixed gateways for \gls{ML} decision-making
making it unsuitable for decentralized operation. The Chorus~\cite{chorus2021}
routing framework also operates on Raspberry Pi devices and utilizes
\gls{ZigBee}, \gls{BLE} and Wi-Fi, however, it places routing decisions on a
cloud coordinator that floods the network \emph{a priori}, meaning it cannot
adapt to disaster circumstances should that coordinator fail.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{subsec:rw_discussion_3}

Existing frameworks demonstrate the technical feasibility of heterogeneous
channel/protocol coordination but rely on centralized control mechanisms
incompatible with disaster scenarios. AWCT~\cite{awct} depends on centralized
\gls{LoRaWAN} gateways for Internet connectivity, the heterogeneous disaster
architecture~\cite{heterogeneous-disaster} uses centralized \gls{NVIS}
coordination with minimum 20-second send intervals at 10 hops,
MCSC-WoT~\cite{mcsc-wot} requires master nodes broadcasting synchronization
signals, the multi-protocol gateway~\cite{multiproto_gateway} validates
multi-radio operation but imposes tree topologies with gateway coordinators as
single points of failure, and MINOS~\cite{minos2019},  MARS~\cite{mars2025},
and Chorus~\cite{chorus2021} all assume some form of persistent
infrastructure.\\

% While adaptive protocol selection frameworks~\cite{adaptive2025} provide
% runtime switching strategies, they assume infrastructure availability
% (\gls{MQTT} brokers, \gls{HTTP} servers, \gls{CoAP} endpoints) and have not
% been validated on embedded platforms.\\

We have found no work that addresses fully distributed multi-radio coordination
where nodes can autonomously select and switch communication technologies
without resorting to persistent infrastructure.

\todo{REMOVED: ubabel's approach will...}
% \gls{ubabel}'s approach to decentralized protocol selection is detailed in
% Section \ref{component:protocol_manager} along with masterless synchronization
% mechanisms.
