\section{Progress Report}
\label{sec:progress}

The implementation of \gls{ubabel} is currently in its early stages, with
protocol-specific handlers under development. 

The Core Infrastructure Layer (Section~\ref{subsec:core_infra}) is partially
complete. \glspl{HAL} for peripheral access (\gls{GPIO}, \gls{SPI} and
\gls{I2C}) are functional across both ESP-IDF and Pico SDK platforms; the Event
Dispatcher is operational, providing event-driven communication between
components, and the Communication Manager currently supports Wi-Fi peer
connection management, and unicast/multicast message delivery.

The Discovery \& Topology Layer (Section~\ref{subsec:discovery_topology}) has
one working component in the Peer Discovery Service, which currently supports
discovery over Wi-Fi.

The Coordination (Section~\ref{subsec:coordination}), and Data Management
(Section~\ref{subsec:data_management}) Components remain in the planning and design
phase.

\paragraph{Proof-of-Concept Deployment:} The current system has been deployed
and tested on M5Stack Core Basic~\cite{m5corebasic} devices (ESP32-based) by
commanding multiple Raspberry Pi 5 boards attached to actuators, demonstrating
an "inversion of control" to signal the flexibility and potential of the
proposed system.
