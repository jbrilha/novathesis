\section{Progress Report}
\label{sec:progress}

The implementation of \gls{ubabel} is currently in its early stages, with
protocol-specific handlers under development. 

\glspl{HAL} for peripheral access (\gls{GPIO}, \gls{SPI} and \gls{I2C}) are
functional across both ESP-IDF and Pico SDK platforms. The implementation of
the Core Components (Section~\ref{subsec:core_components}) is partially
complete: the Protocol Manager supports basic protocol registration and lookup,
the Event Dispatcher is operational, providing event-driven communication
between components, the Communication Manager currently supports Wi-Fi peer
connection management, and unicast/multicast message delivery. The Time
Synchronization Service is still in the planning stage.

The User-Level protocols (Section~\ref{subsec:user_protos}) has one working
component in the Peer Discovery Service, which currently supports discovery
over Wi-Fi, while the Topology Manager is still in the planning stage.

\paragraph{Proof-of-Concept Deployment:} The current system has been deployed
and tested on M5Stack Core Basic~\cite{m5corebasic} devices (ESP32-based) by
commanding multiple Raspberry Pi 5 boards attached to actuators, demonstrating
an "inversion of control" to signal the flexibility and potential of the
proposed system in the context of the \textbf{TaRDIS} project funded by the
European Union's \emph{Horizon Europe} program.
