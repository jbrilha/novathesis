\todo{mencionar MQTT, CoAP em detalhe somewhere?}

\gls{iot} and home automation (domotics) systems share the same technological
building blocks (wireless sensors, embedded devices, network communication) but
diverge significantly in their operational focus and architectures:

\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{\gls{iot} systems} typically focus on \textbf{data collection
        and monitoring}, by streaming sensor readings to centralized platforms
        for analysis and processing, with control functions often being a
        secondary concern.
    \item \textbf{Domotics systems} instead prioritize \textbf{real-time
        control and actuation} over physical spaces, where responsiveness and
        local autonomy are paramount for end user experience and privacy.
\end{description}

This distinction gains additional relevance when focusing on resilience
requirements: while \gls{iot} deployments may tolerate delayed data aggregation
and/or temporary connectivity issues in monitoring scenarios, domotics
applications (such as emergency lighting control or \gls{HVAC} management)
demand immediate local response regardless of network conditions.

Both domains, however, suffer from a common vulnerability when confronted with
infrastructure failures during disasters: their predominantly cloud-centric
architectures collapse precisely when autonomous operation becomes
indispensable.\\

The challenges faced by disaster-resilient \gls{iot} systems span multiple
dimensions:
\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure failures} eliminate access points that devices
        depend on for coordination;
    \item \textbf{Intermittent connectivity} creates network partitions where
        subgroups of devices must operate autonomously without global state
        synchronization;
    \item \textbf{Resource constraints} limit the computational, memory and
        energy budgets available for implementing sophisticated resilience
        mechanisms in embedded platforms.
\end{description}

\todo{FIXED: "suavizar" o parágrafo: mais sobre o problema menos sobre o uBabel}
These challenges are fundamentally architectural: existing \gls{iot} and
domotics systems are designed around the assumption of stable infrastructure,
treating network partitions and coordinator failures as transient anomalies
rather than the norm.

Cloud-centric architectures place control decisions in remote servers, creating
dependencies that cannot be satisfied when connectivity fails.
Coordinator-based topologies (whether using dedicated gateways, master nodes,
\gls{SDN} controllers, ...) concentrate the risk of failure in single points
that can paralyze entire networks if compromised or disconnected. Even
ostensibly distributed systems often rely on persistent connections (i.e.,
\gls{TCP}) over a single medium, or heavy middleware platforms that exceed the
capabilities of embedded devices and, once more, assume some form of
infrastructure availability.

The fundamental point of contention is between resilience requirements
(autonomy during infrastructure collapse) and resource constraints (limited
computation, memory, and energy). Traditional approaches address one at the
cost of the other: cloud platforms provide sophisticated coordination but fail
during outages; purely local systems avoid external dependencies but struggle
with inter-device coordination and protocol heterogeneity with low resource
usage.

Disaster-resilient systems require architectural choices that prioritize
autonomous \gls{P2P} connectivity as the baseline mode of operation rather than
having it as a secondary -- even exceptional -- fallback mechanism.

Naturally, this requires a fundamental rethinking of \gls{iot} systems design:
how devices discover and communicate with each other using diverse protocol
stacks (without depending on centralized cotnrol), how they achieve temporal
synchronization and coordination without master beacons, how to optimize the
usage limited available resources, and how to maintain secure operation
throughout without persistent access to \glspl{CA} or \glspl{KDC}.\\

\todo{parágrafo antigo movido para chap 3, WIP ainda}

The following sections briefly cover related work across five areas that
collectively enable autonomous operation: (Section \ref{sec:multi_protocol})
multi-protocol communication and adaptive selection based on \gls{QoS} and
device capabilities; (Section~\ref{sec:p2p_mesh}) \gls{P2P} mesh networking and
topology management for autonomous network formation without coordinator
dependencies; (Section~\ref{sec:decentralized_sync}) decentralized
synchronization mechanisms for coordinating multi-protocol communication
without master nodes; (Section~\ref{sec:data_compression}) lightweight data
compression and energy optimization techniques to extend autonomous operation
duration and device lifetime; and (Section~\ref{sec:security_privacy}) security
and privacy mechanisms that enable systems to maintain secure communication
after infrastructure failures.

For each area, we examine how existing approaches handle (or fail to handle)
infrastructure failure scenarios, identify architectural assumptions that
conflict with disaster-resilient requirements, and position
\textbf{\gls{ubabel}}'s contributions relative to the current state of the art.
