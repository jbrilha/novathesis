\todo{mencionar MQTT, CoAP em detalhe somewhere?}

\gls{iot} and home automation (domotics) systems share the same
technological building blocks (wireless sensors, embedded devices, network
communication) but diverge significantly in their operational focus and
architectures:

\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{\gls{iot} systems} typically focus on \textbf{data collection and
		      monitoring}, by streaming sensor readings to centralized platforms for
	      analysis and processing, with control functions often being a secondary
	      concern.
	\item \textbf{Domotics systems} instead prioritize \textbf{real-time
		      control and actuation} over physical spaces, where responsiveness and
	      local autonomy are paramount for end user experience and privacy.
\end{description}

This distinction gains additional relevance when focusing on resilience
requirements: while \gls{iot} deployments may tolerate delayed data aggregation
and/or temporary connectivity issues in monitoring scenarios, domotics
applications (such as emergency lighting control or \gls{HVAC} management) demand
immediate local response regardless of network conditions.

Both domains, however, suffer from a common vulnerability when confronted with
infrastructure failures during disasters: their predominantly cloud-centric
architectures collapse precisely when autonomous operation becomes
indispensable.\\

The challenges faced by disaster-resilient \gls{iot} systems span multiple dimensions:
\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{Infrastructure failures} eliminate access points that devices
	      depend on for coordination;
	\item \textbf{Intermittent connectivity} creates network partitions where
	      subgroups of devices must operate autonomously without global state
	      synchronization;
	\item \textbf{Resource constraints} limit the computational, memory and
	      energy budgets available for implementing sophisticated resilience
	      mechanisms in embedded platforms.
\end{description}

\textbf{\gls{ubabel}} addresses these concerns through a decentralized approach
that aims to eliminate the dependency on centralized coordination, continuous
connectivity and cloud infrastructure.

Rather than treating infrastructure failures as an exceptional condition
requiring failover mechanisms, our architecture focuses on autonomous
\gls{P2P} connectivity as the baseline mode of operation, with
infrastructure integration as an added benefit when available, rather than a
hard dependency.

This approach means rethinking multiple aspects of traditional \gls{iot} systems
design: from multi-protocol communication strategies that adapt to the
available mediums and device resources without centralized control, to
gossip-based synchronization mechanisms that achieve coordination through local
interactions, to lightweight data compression techniques to make the most out
of the limited storage and battery available in each device.

The following sections briefly cover related work across five areas that
collectively enable autonomous operation: (Section \ref{sec:multi_protocol})
multi-protocol communication and adaptive selection based on \gls{QoS} and device
capabilities; (Section~\ref{sec:p2p_mesh}) \gls{P2P} mesh networking and
topology management for autonomous network formation without coordinator
dependencies; (Section~\ref{sec:decentralized_sync}) decentralized synchronization
mechanisms for coordinating multi-protocol communication without master nodes;
(Section~\ref{sec:data_compression}) lightweight data compression and energy
optimization techniques to extend autonomous operation duration and device
lifetime; and (Section~\ref{sec:security_privacy}) security and privacy mechanisms that
enable systems to maintain secure communication after infrastructure failures.

For each area, we examine how existing approaches handle (or fail to handle)
infrastructure failure scenarios, identify architectural assumptions that
conflict with disaster-resilient requirements, and position
\textbf{\gls{ubabel}}'s contributions relative to the current state of the art.
