\todo{FIXED: added chapter summary}

In this chapter we contextualized the challenges that prevent autonomous
operation in scenarios where infrastructure is not guaranteed to be available.
We formalized the requirements that will allow the proposed solution to
overcome those challenges, defined the operational conditions and failures
modes, identified the targeted hardware and the trade-offs inherent to each of
the selected communication technologies, and presented the software stack that
will be the basis of our solution.

In the following chapter we cover the current state of development and present
a timeline for completing the implementation of the proposed solution and
validating it.
