                client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a
                remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.
                The security model used for this is the origin-based security
                model commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an
                opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over
                TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for
                browser-based applications that need two-way communication with
                servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections
                (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or \textless{}iframe\textgreater{}s

    abstract = {Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in
                which both the routers and their interconnect are constrained.
                LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing
                power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects
                are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and
                instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to
                thousands of routers. Supported traffic flows include
                point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN),
                point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of
                devices inside the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices
                inside the LLN towards a central control point). This document
                specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
                Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby
                multipoint-to-point traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a
                central control point as well as point-to-multipoint traffic from
                the central control point to the devices inside the LLN are
                supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available.
